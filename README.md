# Wireless-PPG-Signal-Activity-Monitoring
In recent years, wireless photoplethysmography
(PPG) has emerged as a pivotal technology for non-invasive
monitoring of physiological parameters. This paper presents
a comprehensive study on the application of wireless PPG
signal acquisition for activity monitoring. The research focuses
on the development and implementation of a robust, real-time
monitoring system that leverages wireless PPG sensors to track
vital signs such as heart rate and oxygen saturation during
various physical activities.
